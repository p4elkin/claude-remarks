# Claude Remarks — Design Document

## Overview

A remark is a short note you attach to a line range in a file without modifying the file itself. The plugin stores all remarks persistently so they survive IDE restarts. If the file changes, the plugin checks whether the remark still points at the right lines.

This document describes how remarks are stored and kept pointed at the correct lines. Future sessions should be able to read this and understand the system without re-reading the source code.

## The Data Model

### What a Remark Contains

A remark has these fields:

- `id`: A unique identifier (generated UUID).
- `path`: The file path, relative to the project root. Produced by `VfsUtilCore.getRelativePath(file, projectRoot)`. This is what gets shown in the tool window and written into dispatch prompts.
- `startLine`, `endLine`: The 0-based, inclusive line numbers of the anchored range.
- `text`: The user's note (what they wrote in the remark).
- `tag`: An optional category from `RemarkTag.BUG | QUESTION | REFACTOR | NOTE`.
- `status`: One of `RemarkStatus.PENDING` or `PENDING | SENT`.
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the remark was created.
- `textHash`: The first 16 hex characters of a SHA-256 hash of the lines at creation time.
- `contextBefore`, `contextAfter`: A few lines of context from above and below the remark, joined with newlines in a single string. Stored this way instead of as a list because the serializer handles single strings more predictably.

All fields are stored flat as XML attributes on a single element.

### Where Remarks are Stored

Remarks are stored in `.idea/workspace.xml` using the IntelliJ Platform's persistence API.

Why this location:

- The IDE's generated `.idea/.gitignore` excludes `/workspace.xml`. No extra work is needed to keep remarks out of version control.
- This is where the IDE keeps other local-only data like breakpoints and bookmarks.

Why not a custom file like `.idea/claudeRemarks.xml`:

- The IDE's `.gitignore` does not cover custom files. They would be committed in any repository that tracks `.idea/`.

Why not `CACHE_FILE`:

- It stores outside the project, which would work, but "Invalidate Caches" would silently wipe all remarks. We never silently delete anything.

Storage is configured with `RoamingType.DISABLED` so remarks do not travel through JetBrains Settings Sync to other machines, where file paths would not resolve.

### How Remarks are Persisted

The `RemarkStore` class extends `SimplePersistentStateComponent<RemarksState>`. The nested `RemarksState` class extends `BaseState` and holds a list of `RemarkState` objects.

The list property uses this annotation:

```kotlin
@get:XCollection(style = XCollection.Style.v2)
val remarks by list<RemarkState>()
```

**This annotation is critical.** Without `@get:XCollection(style = XCollection.Style.v2)`, the entire list serializes to an empty element and every remark is silently lost on IDE restart, with no error logged. See `RemarkStoreSerializationTest` in the test suite — it is the regression guard for this exact trap.

Similarly, `BaseState` does not notice in-place collection changes. After calling `remarks.add(...)` or `remarks.removeIf(...)`, you must call `incrementModificationCount()` to tell the state it has changed. That method is protected, so it can only be called from inside a `BaseState` subclass. This is why mutators live on the state class itself, not on the store.

## The Anchoring Design

Anchoring solves this problem: you mark lines 10-12 in a file. Then someone edits the file — adds lines above, changes the marked lines themselves, deletes their context. Your remark needs to say "these lines moved" or "I could not find them" rather than silently staying at the wrong place.

### The Anchor and AnchorResult Types

An `Anchor` holds:

- `startLine`, `endLine`: The original 0-based line numbers (0-based, inclusive).
- `textHash`: First 16 hex chars of SHA-256 over the trimmed lines. Trimming means reformatting that only changes indentation still resolves.
- `contextBefore`, `contextAfter`: Lists of the 3 lines above and below (by default, configurable).

`resolveAnchor` takes an `Anchor` and the current file contents and returns an `AnchorResult`:

- `Exact(startLine, endLine)`: The lines at the stored numbers still hash to the same text.
- `Relocated(startLine, endLine)`: The text moved elsewhere, or it changed but the surrounding lines stayed the same.
- `Orphaned(staleStartLine, staleEndLine)`: Could not find the text or its context nearby. Reports the original numbers so you can see what is stale.

### The Two-Pass Search

`resolveAnchor` works in two passes, nearest-first outward from the stored line:

1. **Hash match (first pass)**: Scan up to 200 lines in each direction from the stored start position. Look for any block of the same length that hashes to the same value. If found, the text is unchanged but moved — return `Relocated`.

2. **Context match (second pass)**: Scan the same 200-line radius. For each candidate position, check whether the lines immediately above and below match the stored context (trimmed, so indentation is ignored). If at least one context line is non-blank and all context lines match, return `Relocated`.

Why two passes?

- Pass one catches the common case: lines added or removed above the marked block, but the block itself is unchanged.
- Pass two catches the other case: the block itself was edited, but what surrounds it stayed in place.

Why require at least one non-blank context line to match?

- A run of empty lines should not match everywhere in the file. Requiring substance prevents false positives.

If neither pass finds a match within 200 lines, the remark is orphaned. It is kept (not deleted) but shown with its stale line numbers.

### Why Trimmed Hashing

Lines are trimmed before hashing so that reformatting that only changes indentation still resolves. The hash is SHA-256 truncated to 16 hex characters to keep `workspace.xml` small. A hash collision would relocate a remark to the wrong place, which is visible and correctable, not silent data loss.

### Why Context Lines

The plain hash alone can miss edits. If you mark lines 5-7 and someone edits them, the hash no longer matches. The second pass then looks at what is above and below. If the surrounding lines stayed the same, the remark likely still points at the right block, just with different content. Context matching finds it.

## The ProjectUtil Trap

`Project.getBaseDir()` is deprecated. Its deprecation note points at `com.intellij.openapi.project.ProjectUtil.guessProjectDir`. However, that class lives in the platform's internal API — it is on the compile classpath but marked as Kotlin-internal, so the Kotlin compiler rejects it with "Unresolved reference 'ProjectUtil'" even though Java code can use it.

The replacement is `project.basePath` (a String) resolved through `LocalFileSystem.getInstance().findFileByPath(it)` to get the `VirtualFile`. This is wrapped in one helper function, `projectRoot`, in `store/ProjectPaths.kt`.

## Why the Bookmarks API Was Rejected

The IntelliJ Platform's Bookmarks API is close:

- `LineBookmark` anchors to a file plus a line.
- `LineBookmarkImpl` stores `expectedText` (the line's text at creation time), used to detect and repair drift. That is the same trick we use, just unhashed.
- `BookmarkState` has a `description` field, so free-text notes already persist.

**But it does not fit for one concrete reason.** `LineBookmark.line` is a single `Int`. There is no range bookmark in the provider hierarchy. Remarks need line ranges. Building that would mean writing a custom `BookmarkProvider` against an API designed around one line. The only gain would be reusing `BookmarkState` for storage — a handful of lines. So we built a custom persistent state component.

## What Is Not Yet Built

Phases 3-5 are deferred:

- **RangeMarker tracking**: While a document is open, a `RangeMarker` per remark lets the platform move the marker as you type. Phase 2 does not need this — there is no gutter and no live editing yet. It belongs with the gutter work in phase 3.

- **FileEditorManagerListener**: Phase 2 resolves remarks on demand when you click Refresh. Phase 3 should subscribe to file editor events for live refresh when you open or edit a file. Use `project.messageBus.connect(disposable)` in Kotlin; do not use the XML `<projectListeners>` route, whose `topic=` attribute format is not clearly documented.

- **Inline input, gutter icons, prompt rendering, dispatch**: Not built. Phase 2 uses a debug action with fixed text.

- **The two-pass search has never been exercised in a real IDE.** Phase 2 was tested in unit tests only. A person should run `./gradlew runIde` once to confirm the tool window launches and remarks persist before phase 3 starts.

## Performance Tuning Knobs

The search radius is 200 lines. If remarks orphan more often in real use, lower it to speed up the search. If they orphan too rarely, raise it.

The context lines count is 3. If context matching finds false positives, raise it. If it misses real matches, lower it.

Both are in `Anchoring.kt` as `SEARCH_RADIUS` and `CONTEXT_LINES`.
